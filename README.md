3. Implement counters for the number of tweets and hashtags we've analyzed since the user opened the index page.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to handle large amounts of data within non-relational databases, and how to optimize queries for time complexity.
2. Explore implementations of JavaScript on the server side through Node.js and Express.
3. Utilize sockets to render information on the client side in real time and without refreshing the page.
4. Work with a streaming application programming interface.
